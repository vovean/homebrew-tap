  # The app is ad-hoc signed rather than Developer ID signed and notarized, so Gatekeeper
  # blocks it once Homebrew's download carries the quarantine flag. Clearing it here is
  # what `--no-quarantine` would do, applied only to this app so the user does not have to
  # remember a flag. Notarizing instead would need an Apple Developer membership.

  # No `delete:` for the app. Homebrew runs the uninstall stanza before removing the
  # `app` artifact, so deleting the bundle here pulls it out from under that step and the
  # upgrade aborts with the old version already gone — leaving no app, a dangling binary
  # symlink, and brew still recording the previous version. The `app` stanza removes the
  # bundle and `binary` is unlinked automatically.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Shell wrappers are not installed automatically. To add them:

      ccmux shell-init >> ~/.zshrc

    To start ccmux at login:

      ccmux install-agent

    Open the app once and allow notifications: a prompt that is dismissed leaves the
    bundle denied, and re-asking will not bring it back.
